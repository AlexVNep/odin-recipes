    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      I had a delicious bowl of cream of asparagus soup at a cute cafe while on
      a work trip in Oklahoma City several years ago. I spent a year trying to
      recreate my own version of this heartwarming soup. With the collaboration
      of my family's ideas, I have come up with a version of the soup I serve
      for our formal holiday meals as a starter course.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>3 slices of bacon</li>
      <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
      <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
      <li>1 onion diced</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 potato, peeled and sliced</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, tips set aside and stalks chopped</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>3/4 cup half-and-half cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat,
        turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain
        bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble bacon when cool; set aside.
        Reserve 1 tablespoon bacon drippings in a small bowl. Set aside the
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>Melt butter with drippings in a large saucepan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir celery and onion in hot butter-drippings until onion is
        translucent, about 4 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute.
        Whisk in chicken broth and bring to a boil. Add potato and asparagus,
        reserving asparagus tips for later. Season with salt and ground black
        pepper. Reduce heat and simmer soup for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway.
        Holding down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, start
        the blender, using a few quick pulses to get soup moving before leaving
        it on to purée. Purée in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.
        Alternately, you can use a stick blender and purée soup right in the
        cooking pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir mushrooms and asparagus tips in the same skillet used for
        bacon until mushrooms release their liquid, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with
        salt and ground black pepper, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir mushrooms, asparagus tips, and half-and-half cream into puréed
        soup. Cook until thoroughly heated.
      </li>
      <li>Portion soup into bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon.</li>
    </ol>
